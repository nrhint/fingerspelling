The goal of this branch is to make the program more efficient. Currently there are several design things that I would like to change. 

1) This includes having the images stored in a different places and downloading them from a different place to make the initial package smaller. 
    a) Revamp the updating portion to be able to download specific things

2) Make the program more efficient. I was watching and when the program plays the word it pops the CPU core to 100% I want to make this smaller if I can.
    a) Use wait flags?
    b) Transition to pygame for better support during fast words


FINISHED:
3) Add the stuff to make the program optimize automatically as you use it.
    a) Add a scoring system to each word. Increase communication between threads with queues

4) Update the dictionary
