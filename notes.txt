This is being made because I can not keep strait what is happening.

Problem: it takes a long time to open a file and read the image. I am simply trying to store the data in a pickled file. I am getting around this by opening the image in PIL then pickling the opened images. This is causing memory problems because it is not being cleaned up. I am solving this by using multiprocessing. This is allowing me to not have to worry because when pickle dumps it uses a large amount of memory.

main.py --> util.playWord.py --> util.loadImages.py (New process)-- >
