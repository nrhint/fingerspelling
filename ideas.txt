ToDo:
Filter the dictionaries for any words that have more than 2 repeating letters.

Features:
Make it so that you can choose a custom list of words
Make the program track:
 - Frequency of missed words
 - Which words missed
 - Which words were not missed
Display the results on a graph
Score based on the number of words gotten in a row
allow the user to pick exactly how many letters to be in each word
use the similataries between the missed words and try to make a training module that will train those commonly missed words and things
make an option to randomly mispell words (Find a dictionary of common mispellings and add that to the list)
speed (maybe add a function that common letter combos are faster than the rest)
